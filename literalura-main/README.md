# literAlura (Alura - ONE Java Back-End Challenge)

This repository contains the Java Back-End solution to the challenge proposed in the [Alura Latam](https://github.com/alura-es-cursos) / Oracle Java Back-End course, part of the ONE program. The challenge involves creating a library application that consumes the [Gutendex-API](https://gutendex.com/) to retrieve book and author information. In this challenge, I work with concepts of the Spring Framework, JPA, and PostgreSQL database
<br>
You can search for any book available in the Gutendex API and store all its information, such as title, author, and language. Note: You cannot add the same book more than once.


* Open it with your favorite Java IDE
